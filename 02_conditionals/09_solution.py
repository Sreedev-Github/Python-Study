# 9. Leap Year Checker
# Problem: Determine if a year is a leap year. (Leap years are divisible by 4, but not by 100 unless also divisible by 400).

year = 2024
# You have to wrap if you are using mutiple condition checks in if else statement
if (year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 != 0) or (year % 400 == 0):
    print(year,"is a leap year")
else:
    print(year, "is not a leap year")
